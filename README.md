# Task Sync

We use different APIs of slack, X, discord, etc and create tools from it. What about if we create APIs of a phone like clicks (for interaction), screenshot (for knowing what happened after clicking), clipboard, etc and create a tool of it. Users need to prompt from their laptop and agents can take actions on their phone. It works like a manager who will handle your task and also it will not disturb you (as you will not be using your phone at that time, so he can take his time and resources to accomplish the task).
